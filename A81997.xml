            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>By Letters from the North intelligence was received of a ſtrange accident, or rather a miracle, which hapned in thoſe parts. Alſo a Gent. who was an eye-witneſſe, and ſaw the ſame, did teſtifie, both by word of mouth, and under his hand writing, doth affirm that at <hi>Shereborn</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> on the 24. day of this laſt <hi>March,</hi> in the afternoon, aroſe a great ſtorm, beginning firſt with Rain, which was powred downe in great abundance; aftes which inſtantly ſucceeded a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhowr of Hayl being powred down with ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary force &amp; violence, that it brake mrny glaſſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, kil'd Geeſe, Ducks, and other ſuch feeble creatures as wanted ſhelter. After the haile was over, their iſſued out of the Aire a great ſhowr of wheat; ſo that in ſome places it covered the gronud, &amp; it was in all reſpects like unto the commou wheat whereof bread is made, both for colour &amp; form, but that it was ſomething of a more ſad or darke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour then our ordinary wheat. It hath been likewiſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by others, &amp; affirmed, that the poor people gathered up ſome of it, &amp; made bread thereof, which they eat, &amp; found it in operation like unto other ordinary bread, that bread was ſomething for colour and taſt like unto bread made of Rye. The fore-mentioned haile-ſtones were of a very great bigneſſe, many of them being as big as ſmal Wal-nuts, or Nutmegs, and ſome bigger; alſo this hail was ſo hard, that ſome carryed them 4 or 5 miles in their pockets to ſhew, and yet they were not melted. The people in thoſe parts which ſaw it are very much amazed at it; ſome think it to be a ſign of a famine; others think it to be a ſigne that Bread-corn, or Wheat, or Rye, or the like, in Harveſt ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, by ſome extraordinary ſtorm of Haile or Raine, or ſome ſuch accident, but none can aſſuredly tell what it prognoſticates; but ſurely, ſuch ſtrange and unuſual things, are ſignes of ſome great alterations.</p>

At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the expectation of the malignants are great, and reports variable, but little concluded on: only we hear that they are reſolved, that an army ſhal be ſent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and although many wil not be perſwaded to believe it, yet it may now more eaſily be gathered, that ſuch a thing is intended, and wil ſpeedily be effected, if not prevented; for the Scots army draws Southward, and many of them are ordered to be quartered neer the Borders, the Lord <hi>Belca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe</hi> Troop have taken up their quarters within five miles of Berwick, having order ſo to doe. Many other Troopes have quarters aſſigned them in the South of Scotland, and eſpecialy in the Townes and Villages nrer adjoyning to <hi>England;</hi> alſo from other parts of Scotland we perceive the Scots Forces to creep Southward, but they are wary, and do it by little and little, the better to avoid ſuſpition, but if their intents are, as is ſuſpected, <hi>England</hi> may chance to fruſtrate their deſigns, and the Scots after all their jugling be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their expectations.</p>
